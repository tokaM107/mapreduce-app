## 1. how to install hadoop?
1. get hadoop running on docker is pretty easy so you need to have docker installed on linux or wsl on windows (I don't recommend docker desktop)
2. clone this repo into your linux machine
3. make sure your current directory is the directory of this repo
4. ```docker-compose up -d```
5. wait for it and congratulations, hadoop is installed & running. hit http://localhost:9870 to check if hdfs is running and healthy
